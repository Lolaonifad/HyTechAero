* Other team's rear endplates.

From what I've observed, the rear endplates have varied shapes. I can't observe any angle when it comes to change in angle from top view.
I'd imagine that having an angled endplate would help turn the car AND would shift the center of pressure backwards while turning. This should make the car a little more manageable in the future.

I wonder how different shapes create different vortices. Obviously this region must have a fine mesh when we use Docker to test our design.
To future V, I wish you Godspeed on your endeavors.
