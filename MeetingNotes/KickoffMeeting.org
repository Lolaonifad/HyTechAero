*** Description
HyTech Racing is a student team at the Georgia Institute of Technology that formed with the intent of competing at the Formula Hybrid International Competition.
The annual Formula Hybrid International Competition is an offshoot from the prestigious Formula SAE Competition.
Hosted by Dartmouth College, it has been held five times starting in 2007 at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway.
From late April to early May, teams from educational institutions around the world bring plug-in hybrid-electric, open-wheeled vehicles to perform in a variety of design and performance challenges.
Design, Endurance, Autocross, and Acceleration events emphasize the importance of a balance between performance and efficiency.
Our team formed in October of 2011 with a daunting goal in mind: to design, build, and test a hybrid vehicle in less than seven months.
In order to accomplish this goal, we apply knowledge learned in the classroom to produce a high-performance, fuel-efficient machine.
The design and build of a HyTech vehicle represents a vastly interdisciplinary process that will test our members on many levels.
The knowledge and skill set that we can gain through a hands-on project will improve our ability to add value to any organizations we become a part of in the future.
We have a designated office and prime warehouse space in Georgia Tech’s Student Competition Center where we will design and build our vehicle.

The primary objectives for HyTech Racing are as follows: 
- Provide hands-on engineering and organizational experience 
- Allow students to seek creative solutions for performance and efficiency in motor vehicles 
- Produce a competitive hybrid vehicle for the team’s first event that can be improved in coming years

*** The Competition
The way we move around the world is changing.  
As global warming, diminishing petroleum resources, and air pollution make traditional internal combustion vehicles less attractive every day, the race for effective solutions is on.
To foster learning and creative processes toward this problem, international educational institutions and corporations alike are promoting unique challenges that encourage students to design and build modern vehicles.
SAE International is perhaps the most important agent in promoting such challenges.
​
The annual Formula Hybrid International Competition is an offshoot from the prestigious Formula SAE Competition.
Hosted by Dartmouth College, it has been held every year since its founding in 2006 at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway.
In late April to early May, teams from educational institutions around the world bring plug-in hybrid-electric, open-wheeled vehicles to perform in a variety of design and performance challenges.
Design, Endurance, Autocross, and Acceleration events emphasize the importance of a balance between performance and efficiency.
*** Who We Are
HyTech Racing is Georgia Tech’s first and only team created to participate in the Formula Hybrid Competition.
Our team’s formation began with the election of a Project Lead and Chief Engineer on September 28, 2011.
Our goal is to address the challenges presented by the competition while learning how to design, build, and optimize advanced machines.
We also embrace the opportunity to gain experience in leadership, communication, business development, and effective time management throughout the course of the project.

The design and build of a “HyTech” vehicle represents a vastly interdisciplinary process that will test our members on many levels, and make them more prepared to face real-world challenges in the workplace after graduation.
The knowledge and skill set that we can gain through a hands-on project where a student-run group acts as an entire business unit will improve our ability to add value to whatever organizations we may become a part of in the future.
While an education in the classroom is necessary, an education in this team environment can teach us lessons far beyond the scope of traditional learning.

We have a designated workplace in Georgia Tech’s new, coveted Student Competition Center, with plenty of space and resources to design and build our vehicle inside prime warehouse space and our private office.
Other Georgia Tech automotive teams have adjacent spaces at our Student Competition Center, including GT Motorsports, Wreck Racing, and the Solar Jackets.
These teams have a long history of continued excellence in competition, and we plan to build upon this legacy.

*** Meetings
The team meets every Tuesday and Thursday at 7:00 PM at the Student Competition Center (SCC).
Additionally the team meats on Sundays at 4:00 PM.
The Student Competition Center can be accessed via the Stinger Green Route, the Stinerette, or a ride from any team member.

*** Front Page
HyTech Racing, a student-run organization at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is dedicated to the design and development of an electric vehicle for the Formula SAE Electric and Formula Hybrid Electric series.

At HyTech Racing, our goal is to gain a deep understanding of all aspects of vehicle design and development. Each member of our team has a chance to learn about all components of vehicle design and production through research, CAD design, machining, component sourcing, project management, manufacturing and testing.

*** Cars 
**** 2016
This year HyTech designed and built our vehicle to compete in both Formula Hybrid and Formula SAE Electric competitions.

***** Chassis Details
- Completely new team-designed frame
- Torsional stiffness FEA: 2550 ft.lb/deg
- MDF jig designed for efficient and accurate chassis welding

***** Driveline Details
- Motor output (front) sprocket and rear sprocket designed and machined in-house
- Front sprocket machined out of Aluminum 2024 to reduce weight (versus Steel) while maintaining a factor of safety >1
- Hard mounted differential carriers machined out of Aluminum 6061; sticking to a robust and tested design
- Motor mount manufactured from Steel 4041- reduces stress points, holds up to the maximum torque
- Powered by the Enstroj Emrax 207 which is lighter than the other options in the market, yet powerful enough to handle the load of the car

***** Mechanical Controls Details
- Steering
  + Custom 6061-T6 rack housing allows for low friction rack translation
  + 32x force magnification from steering wheel to steering rack
  + ~5° steering free play
  + 32° of steering
- Brakes
  + Adjustable pedal position for better ergonomics
  + Manufactured with aluminum for decreased weight

***** Suspension Details
- Short 65" wheelbase for lower polar moment of inertia
- 52" track width reduces lateral weight transfer and increases lateral force produced by the tires when cornering
- Steering rods aligned to have just 0.1° of steer for two inches of wheel displacement
- Uprights and hubs CNC machined in-house.
- Hubs designed to be interchangeable between left and right corners
- Camber adjustable from 0° to -5.0° by use of threaded washers at the upper A arm point
- Suspension designed to keep outside wheels at a 0° of camber under the maximum allowable body roll of 2° when cornering.

***** Electrical Controls Details
- Modular system of boards allows for easier development and replacement of controls system components
- Electrical boards designed using EAGLE CAD, then manufactured on campus by team members using printed circuit board milling
- Arduino software developed by team members and shared publicly as open source
- Aluminum battery enclosure and front controls enclosure created using water-jet and in-house welding
- Arduinos communicate with motor controller and battery management system entirely over CAN Bus network
- Real-time data is read by the Arduinos and sent to a steering wheel display

***** High Voltage System Details
- Emrax 207 Medium Voltage motor powers the drivetrain
- Rinehart PM100DX Motor Controller controls the Emrax motor
- Orion Battery Management System tracks cells
- Single accumulator container holds all batteries and most high-voltage components
- 4 team-packaged accumulator segments hold 82 LiFePo4 cells in series

***** Vehicle Categories
Formula Hybrid has three vehicle categories: Hybrid, Hybrid-In-Progress (HIP), and Electric-only.
****** Hybrid 
The Hybrid category is the most challenging of all the SAE Collegiate Design Series engineering competitions, typically requiring thousands of hours of engineering and development time.
****** HIP
HIP is for hybrids that are still under development, such as a two-year design and build cycle.
Hybrid-In-Progress vehicles can be driven on electric power.
****** Electric-only
Electric-only is for vehicles designed for battery/electric drive, and closely parallels the new FSAE Electric rules.
Student teams wishing to enter a FSAE Electric vehicle in the Formula Hybrid Electric-only class should be aware that there are some rules that are different.
Read all of the rules carefully!
